      <h2 class ='section-title'>About Me</h2>
      <h3 class='bio-blurb'>Throughout my academic and professional career, I have focused my efforts in the field of child welfare.  As a former foster youth and child welfare worker, I have devoted my career to improving the experiences of children and families involved in the child welfare system.  I particularly value the opportunity to harness my personal and practice experience to educate future generations of social workers and contribute to the scholarly base informing child welfare theory and practice. </h3>

      <h2 class ='section-title'>Curriculum Vitae</h2>
      <h3 clas='cv-blurb'>My research interests focus on child welfare outcomes, especially reentries to the foster care system, the experience of children who are separated from their siblings while in foster care, substance abuse disorders and treatment for parents involved with the child welfare system, and measures of alcohol and drug abuse severity among parents.  I am also interested in the potential influence of parent-child-social worker relationships on child welfare outcomes. </h3>
